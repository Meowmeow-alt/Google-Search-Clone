## INTRODUCTION:

Have you ever wondered how Google works? How does it find the most relevant and useful information from billions of web pages in a fraction of a second? How does it rank and display the results in a user-friendly way? If you are curious about these questions, then you might have the same passion as I do. 

I love to explore and experiment with new technologies and ideas. Thatâ€™s why I decided to create my own Google search clone for fun.

## DESCRIPTION:

My project is a web application that allows users to search the web using different modes and filters. It has three pages: general search, image search, and advanced search.

## TO-DO:

- Utilize Flask to enhance the organization and structure of the web application. This requires acquiring new skills and knowledge on Flask.
- Develop more interactive and engaging features for the web application.
